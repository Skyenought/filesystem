# Filesystem

[中文](README.md)

File system middleware for [Hertz](https://github.com/cloudwego/hertz) that allows you to serve files from a directory.

⚠️ **`:params` and `:optionals?` in prefix paths are not supported!**

⚠️ **This version is not perfect and the middleware can only be used once with `h.Use`.**

Example usage: [example](./examples/main.go)

For detailed usage, see the comments.
